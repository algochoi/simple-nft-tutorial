# Misc Notes

## What is a blockchain?
Here are some of my thoughts:
* A digital library that stores information that cannot be changed (an immutable database)
* Open to anyone who wants to contribute (Permissionless)
* Resistant to hackers (Byzantine Fault Tolerant)

And maybe if I get deeper:
* A state machine where you can pay something to move from state A to state B, e.g. A vending machine. These state transitions are also called transactions. 
* Each transactions are grouped and packed into a block. A block is an atomic unit of transitions that gets processed by nodes in the blockchain.
